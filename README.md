## Notes from Accessibility Course

Why Accessibility?

1. Accessibility is the right thing to do.
2. Accessibility leads to good practice.
3. Accessibility helps to avoid legal concerns.

Set font sizes using relative values, not specific pixel units. Don't use text in your images. Use plain text instead.
